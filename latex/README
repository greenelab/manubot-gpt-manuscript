Steps to generate/update Latex file:

1. Run: BUILD_PDF=false BUILD_DOCX=false BUILD_LATEX=true bash build/build.sh
2. Use a diff tool to add keep the desired changes.
3. bash build_latex.sh

Steps to generate diff latex file:

1. Download latest latexdiff version (v1.3.3 used here):
   export LATEXDIFF_PATH="/home/miltondp/software/latexdiff-1.3.3/latexdiff"

2. Get the previous and current versions of the .tex file to compare:
   export PREV_VER="v01.1"
   export CURR_VER="v02.0"
   mkdir diffs
   git show ${PREV_VER}:latex/manuscript.tex > diffs/${PREV_VER}.tex
   git show ${CURR_VER}:latex/manuscript.tex > diffs/${CURR_VER}.tex

3. Generate diff between versions:
   ${LATEXDIFF_PATH} \
     --packages=hyperref \
     --no-links \
     diffs/${PREV_VER}.tex \
     diffs/${CURR_VER}.tex > diffs/diff_${PREV_VER}_vs_${CURR_VER}.tex

4. Compile (within latex/ directory):
   latexmk diffs/diff_${PREV_VER}_vs_${CURR_VER}.tex

5. Check diff pdf to ensure everything is correct.

6. Add to git:
   git add diffs/diff_${PREV_VER}_vs_${CURR_VER}.tex
