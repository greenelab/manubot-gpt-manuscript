## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Academics often communicate through scholarly manuscripts, which describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
However, writing and revising manuscripts is a time-consuming process.
Large language models are bringing new capabilities to many areas of knowledge work that have shown impressive performance in different tasks.
We integrated the use of these models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem to automatically revise and improve existing text.
The user can run a workflow that will trigger a series of queries to OpenAI's language models, produce revisions, and create a timestamped set of suggested revisions.
We tested this AI-based revision workflow in existing manuscripts, including the present one.
We found that these models can understand the concepts in scholarly text and produce high-quality revisions that significantly improved the reading.
Given the amount of time that researchers put into crafting prose, we expect this advance to radically transform the type of knowledge work that academics perform.
