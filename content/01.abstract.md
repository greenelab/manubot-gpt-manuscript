## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Writing and revising scholarly manuscripts can be a time-consuming process.
To improve this, Manubot has integrated the use of large language models into its publishing ecosystem.
This workflow triggers a series of queries to OpenAI's language models, produces revisions, and creates a timestamped set of suggested revisions.
With this AI-assisted authoring, researchers can save time and energy and radically transform the type of knowledge work they perform.
