## Abstract {.page_break_before}

This paper investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to reduce the time-consuming process of writing and revising scholarly manuscripts.
To this end, we integrate large language models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem to suggest revisions for scholarly text.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our AI-based revision workflow in three case studies of existing manuscripts, including the present one.
Our results show that these models can capture the concepts in the scholarly text and produce high-quality revisions that improve clarity.
We anticipate that this advance will revolutionize the type of knowledge work performed by academics.
