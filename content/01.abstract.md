## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Academics communicate their research findings, literature reviews, and arguments through scholarly manuscripts.
However, the writing and revising process is often time-consuming.
To improve this, we integrated large language models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem.
This allows users to run a workflow which queries OpenAI's language models, produces revisions, and creates a set of suggested revisions with timestamps.
We believe this will revolutionize the knowledge work academics undertake, saving them time and effort.
