## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Writing and revising scholarly manuscripts can be a time-consuming process for academics.
To address this challenge, we have integrated the use of large language models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem.
This allows users to run a workflow that triggers a series of queries to OpenAI's language models, producing revisions and creating a timestamped set of suggested changes.
By leveraging the power of AI, this advance is expected to revolutionize the type of knowledge work that academics do, significantly reducing the amount of time spent on crafting prose.
