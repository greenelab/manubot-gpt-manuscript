## Abstract {.page_break_before}

This paper explores how advanced natural language processing models can be used to streamline the time-consuming process of scholarly manuscript writing and revision.
Our proposed solution integrates large language models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem to suggest revisions for scholarly text.
Our AI-based revision workflow uses a prompt generator that incorporates manuscript metadata into prompt templates to generate section-specific instructions for the language model.
The model then generates a revised version of each paragraph that the human author can review.
We tested our AI-based revision workflow in three case studies of existing manuscripts, including the present one, and found that the models can capture the concepts in the scholarly text and produce high-quality revisions that improve clarity.
All changes to the manuscript are tracked using a version control system, providing transparency into the origin of text.
This advance in scholarly publishing infrastructure has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of knowledge work performed by academics.
