## Abstract {.page_break_before}

This paper investigates how advanced natural language processing models can reduce the time-consuming process of writing and revising scholarly manuscripts.
We propose an AI-assisted authoring infrastructure by integrating large language models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem.
Our AI-based revision workflow uses a prompt generator to generate section-specific instructions for the language model, which then generates revised versions of each paragraph for the human author to review.
To evaluate our workflow, we conducted three case studies on existing manuscripts, including the present one.
Our results suggest that these models can capture the concepts in the scholarly text and produce high-quality revisions that improve clarity.
We also tracked all changes to the manuscript using a version control system to provide transparency into the human or machine origin of text.
We anticipate that this advance will significantly improve the knowledge work of academics by saving them time and effort.
