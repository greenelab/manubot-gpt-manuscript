## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Scholarly manuscripts are a key way for academics to communicate advances, summarize literature, and advocate for change.
Writing and revising these manuscripts can be a laborious process.
Manubot, a publishing ecosystem, now integrates the use of large language models from OpenAI to automate part of this process.
This allows users to run a workflow that queries OpenAI's language models, produces revisions, and creates a timestamped set of suggested revisions.
This advancement has the potential to revolutionize the type of knowledge work that academics perform, saving them time and effort.
