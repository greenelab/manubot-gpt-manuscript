## Observations of AI-based revisions {#sec:results}

### Evaluation setup

We evaluated our AI-assisted revision workflow using three GPT-3 models from OpenAI: `text-davinci-003`, `text-davinci-edit-001`, and `text-curie-001`.
The first two are based on the most capable Davinci models (see [OpenAI - GPT-3 models](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3)).
Whereas `text-davinci-003` is a production-ready model for the completion endpoint, `text-davinci-edit-001` is used for the edits endpoint and is still in beta.
The latter provides a more natural interface for revising manuscripts, as it takes two inputs: instructions and the text to revise.
Model `text-curie-001` is faster and cheaper than Davinci models, and is defined as "very capable" by its authors (see [OpenAI - GPT-3 models](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3)).

Assessing the performance of an automated revision tool is not straightforward, since a review of a revision will necessarily be subjective.
To mitigate this, we used three manuscripts of our own authorship (Table @tbl:manuscripts): the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) [@doi:10.1101/2022.06.15.496326], PhenoPLIER [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.05.450786], and Manubot-AI (this manuscript).
CCC is a new correlation coefficient evaluated in transcriptomic data, while PhenoPLIER is a framework that comprises three different methods applied in the field of genetic studies.
CCC is in the field of computational biology, whereas PhenoPLIER is in the field of genomic medicine.
CCC describes one computational method applied to one data type (correlation to gene expression).
PhenoPLIER describes a framework that comprises three different approaches (regression, clustering and drug-disease prediction) using data from genome-wide and transcription-wide association studies (GWAS and TWAS), gene expression, and transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations.
Therefore, CCC has a simpler structure, whereas PhenoPLIER is a more complex manuscript with more figures and tables and a Methods section including equations.
The third manuscript, Manubot-AI, provides an example with a simpler structure, and it was written and revised using our tool before submission, which provides a more real AI-based revision use case.
Using these manuscripts, we tested and improved our prompts.
Our findings are reported below.


We enabled the Manubot AI revision workflow in the GitHub repositories of the three manuscripts (CCC: `https://github.com/greenelab/ccc-manuscript`, PhenoPLIER: `https://github.com/greenelab/phenoplier_manuscript`, Manubot-AI: `https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-gpt-manuscript`).
This added the "ai-revision" workflow to the "Actions" tab of each repository.
We triggered the workflow manually and used the three language models described above to produce one pull request (PR) per manuscript and model.
These PRs can be accessed from the "Pull requests" tab of each repository.
They are titled *"GPT (MODEL) used to revise manuscript"* with *MODEL* being the identifier of the model used.
The PRs show the differences between the original text and the AI-based revision suggestions.
We discuss below our findings based on these PRs across different sections of the manuscripts.


### Performance of language models

We found that Davinci models outperformed the Curie model across all manuscripts.
The Curie model is faster and less expensive than Davinci models.
However, the PRs show that the model was not able to produce acceptable revisions for any of the manuscripts.
Most of its suggestions were not coherent with the original text in any of the sections.


We found that the quality of the revisions produced by the `text-davinci-edit-001` (edits endpoint) model was subjectively inferior to `text-davinci-003` (completion endpoint).
This model either did not produce a revision (such as for abstracts) or the suggested changes were minimal or did not improve the original text.
For example, in paragraphs from the introduction, it failed to keep references to other scientific articles in CCC, and in PhenoPLIER it didn't produce a meaningful revision.
This might be because the edits endpoint is still in beta.


The `text-davinci-003` model produced the best results for all manuscripts and across the different sections.
Since both `text-davinci-003` and `text-davinci-edit-001` are based on the same models, we only report the results of `text-davinci-003` below.


### Revision of different sections

We inspected the PRs generated by the AI-based workflow and found interesting changes suggested by the tool across different sections of the manuscripts.
These are our subjective assessments of the quality of the revisions, and we encourage the reader to inspect the PRs for each manuscript and model to see the full diffs and make their own conclusions.
These PRs are available in the manuscripts' GitHub repositories and also included as diff files in Supplementary File 1 (CCC), 2 (PhenoPLIER) and 3 (Manubot-AI).


We present the differences between the original text and the revisions by the tool in a `diff` format (obtained from GitHub).
Line numbers are included to show the length differences.
When applicable, single words are underlined and highlighted in colors to more clearly see the differences within a single sentence.
Red indicates words removed by the tool, green indicates words added, and no underlining indicates words kept unchanged.
The full diffs can be seen by inspecting the PRs for each manuscript and model, and then clicking on the "Files changed" tab.


#### Abstract

![
**Abstract of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/abstract/ccc-abstract.svg "Diffs - CCC abstract"){#fig:abstract:ccc width="100%"}

We applied the AI-based revision workflow to the CCC abstract (Figure @fig:abstract:ccc).
The tool completely rewrote the text, leaving only the last sentence mostly unchanged.
The text was significantly shortened, with longer sentences than the original ones, which could make the abstract slightly harder to read.
The revision removed the first two sentences, which introduced correlation analyses and transcriptomics, and directly stated the purpose of the manuscript.
It also removed details about the method (line 5), and focused on the aims and results obtained, ending with the same last sentence, suggesting a broader application of the coefficient to other data domains (as originally intended by the authors of CCC).
The main concepts were still present in the revised text.


The revised text for the abstract of PhenoPLIER was significantly shortened (from 10 sentences in the original, to only 3 in the revised version).
However, in this case, important concepts (such as GWAS, TWAS, CRISPR) and a proper amount of background information were missing, producing a less informative abstract.


#### Introduction

![
**First paragraph in the Introduction section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/introduction/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC introduction paragraph 01"){#fig:intro:ccc width="100%"}

The tool significantly revised the Introduction section of CCC (Figure @fig:intro:ccc), producing a more concise and clear introductory paragraph.
The revised first sentence concisely incorporated ideas from the original two sentences, introducing the concept of "large datasets" and the opportunities for scientific exploration.
The model generated a more concise second sentence introducing the "need for efficient tools" to find "multiple relationships" in these datasets.
The third sentence connected nicely with the previous one.
All references to scientific literature were kept in the correct Manubot format, although our prompts do not specify the format of the text.
The rest of the sentences in this section were also correctly revised, and could be incorporated into the manuscript with minor or no further changes.


We also observed a high quality revision of the introdution of PhenoPLIER.
However, the model failed to keep the format of citations in one paragraph.
Additionally, the model did not converge to a revised text for the last paragraph, and our tool left an error message as an HTML comment at the top: `The AI model returned an empty string`.
Debugging the prompts revealed this issue, which could be related to the complexity of the paragraph.
However, rerunning the automated revision should solve this as the model is stochastic.


#### Results

![
**A paragraph in the Results section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/results/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC results paragraph 01"){#fig:results:ccc width="100%"}

We tested the tool on a paragraph of the Results section of CCC (Figure @fig:results:ccc).
That paragraph describes Figure 1 of the CCC manuscript [@doi:10.1101/2022.06.15.496326], which shows four different datasets with two variables each, and different relationships or patterns named random/independent, non-coexistence, quadratic, and two-lines.
In addition to having fewer sentences that are slightly longer, the revised paragraph consistently uses only the past tense, whereas the original one has tense shifts.
The revised paragraph also kept all citations, which although is not explicitely mentioned in the prompts for this section (as it is for introductions), in this case is important.
Math was also kept in the original LaTeX format and the figure was correctly referenced using the Manubot syntax.
In the third sentence of the revised paragraph (line 3), the model generated a good summary of how all coefficients performed in the last two, nonlinear patterns, and why CCC was able to capture them.
We, as human authors, would make a single change by the end of this sentence to avoid repeating the word "complexity": *"..., while CCC increased the complexity of the model ~~by using different degrees of complexity~~ to capture the relationships"*.
The revised paragraph is more concise and clearly describes what the figure shows and how CCC works.
We found it remarkable that the model rewrote some of the concepts in the original paragraph (lines 4 to 8) into three new sentences (lines 3 to 5) with the same meaning but more concisely and clearly.
The model also produced high-quality revisions for several other paragraphs that would only need minor changes.


Other paragraphs in CCC, however, needed more changes before being ready to be incorporated into the manuscript.
For instance, for some paragraphs, the model generated a revised text that is shorter, more direct and clear.
However, important details were removed and sometimes sentences changed the meaning.
To address this, we could accept the simplified sentence structure but add back the missing details.


![
**A paragraph in the Results section of PhenoPLIER.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/results/phenoplier-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - PhenoPLIER results paragraph 01"){#fig:results:phenoplier width="100%"}


When applied to the PhenoPLIER manuscript, the model produced high-quality revisions for most paragraphs, while preserving citations and references to figures, tables, and other sections of the manuscript in the Manubot/Markdown format.
In some cases, important details were missing, but they could be easily added back while preserving the improved sentence structure of the revised version.
In other cases, the model's output demonstrated the limitations of revising one paragraph at a time without considering the rest of the text.
For instance, one paragraph described our CRISPR screening approach to assess whether top genes in a latent variable (LV) could represent good therapeutic targets.
The model generated a paragraph with a completely different meaning (Figure @fig:results:phenoplier).
It omitted the CRISPR screen and the gene symbols associated with the regulation of lipids, which were key elements in the original text.
Instead, the new text describes an experiment that does not exist with a reference to a nonexisting section.
This suggests that the model focused on the title and keywords of the manuscript (Table @tbl:manuscripts) that were part of every prompt (Figure @fig:ai_revision).
For example, it included the idea of "gene co-expression" analysis (a keyword) to identify "therapeutic targets" (another keyword) and replaced the mention of "sets of genes" in the original text with "clusters of genes" (closer to the keyword including "clustering").
This was a poor model-based revision, indicating that the original paragraph may be too short or disconnected from the rest and could be merged with the next one (which describes follow-up and related experiments).


#### Discussion

In both the CCC and PhenoPLIER manuscripts, revisions to the discussion section appeared to be of high quality.
The model kept the correct format when necessary (e.g., using italics for gene symbols), maintained most of the citations, and improved the readability of the text in general.
Revisions for some paragraphs introduced minor mistakes that a human author could readily fix.

**A paragraph in the Discussion section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/discussion/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC discussion paragraph 01"){#fig:discussion:ccc width="100%"}

One paragraph of CCC discusses how not-only-linear correlation coefficients could potentially impact genetic studies of complex traits (Figure @fig:discussion:ccc).
Although some minor changes could be added, we believe the revised text reads better than the original.
It is also interesting how the model understood the format of citations and built more complex structures from it.
For instance, the two articles referenced in lines 2 and 3 in the original text were correctly merged into a single citation block and separated with ";" in line 2 of the revised text.


#### Methods

Prompts for the Methods section were the most challenging to design, especially when the sections included equations.
The prompt for Methods (Figure @fig:ai_revision) is more focused in keeping the technical details, which was especially important for PhenoPLIER, whose Methods section contains paragraphs with several mathematical expressions.

![
**A paragraph in the Methods section of PhenoPLIER.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/methods/phenoplier-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - PhenoPLIER methods paragraph 01"){#fig:methods:phenoplier width="100%"}

We revised a paragraph in PhenoPLIER that contained two numbered equations (Figure @fig:methods:phenoplier).
The model made very few changes, and all the equations, citations, and most of the original text were preserved.
However, we found it remarkable how the model identified a wrong reference to a mathematical symbol (line 8) and fixed it in the revision (line 7).
Indeed, the equation with the univariate model used by PrediXcan (lines 4-6 in the original) includes the *true* effect size $\gamma_l$ (`\gamma_l`) instead of the *estimated* one $\hat{\gamma}_l$ (`\hat{\gamma}_l`).


In PhenoPLIER, we found one large paragraph with several equations that the model failed to revise, although it performed relatively well in revising the rest of the section.
In CCC, the revision of this section was good overall, with some minor and easy-to-fix issues as in the other sections.


We also observed issues from revising one paragraph at a time without context.
For instance, in PhenoPLIER, one of the first paragraphs mentions the linear models used by S-PrediXcan and S-MultiXcan, without providing any equations or details.
These were presented in the following paragraphs, but since the model had not encountered that yet, it opted to add those equations immediately (in the correct Manubot/Markdown format).


![
**A paragraph in the Methods section of ManubotAI.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
The revision (right) contains a repeated set of sentences at the top that we removed to improve the clarity of the figure.
](images/diffs/methods/manubotai-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - ManubotAI methods paragraph 01"){#fig:methods:manubotai width="100%"}


When revising the Methods sections of Manubot-AI (this manuscript), in some cases the model added novel sentences with wrong information.
For instance, for one paragraph, it added a formula (using the correct Manubot format) to presumably predict the cost of a revision run.
In another paragraph (Figure @fig:methods:manubotai), it added new sentences saying that the model was *"trained on a corpus of scientific papers from the same field as the manuscript"* and that its suggested revisions resulted in a *"modified version of the manuscript that is ready for submission"*.
Although these are important future directions, neither accurately describes the present work.
