We applied our publishing infrastructure to revise an existing manuscript and create a new one.
We incorporated the changes from Manubot into a manuscript describing the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) [@doi:10.1101/2022.06.15.496326].
This coefficient was designed to detect both linear and non-linear relationships between variables.
The CCC manuscript explains its use, particularly in gene expression data.

: The abstract of the CCC manuscript before revision had a Flesch-Kincaid readability score of X and a grade level of Y [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2003-z].

The abstract of the CCC manuscript before revision had a Flesch-Kincaid readability score of X and a grade level of Y, as reported in [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2003-z].

The readability of the paper was improved after revisions; the readability score was X and the grade level was Y.
Figures were referenced at least once, and citations to other scientific articles were kept.

The complete manuscript before AI-assisted revision is available at [link], while the revised version can be found at [new_link].
We observed that the model has difficulty with the Manubot citation style, which may lead to some references being incorrect.
This pipeline is not completely automated: authors need to review changes and check the output.

We implemented this framework in the context of authoring a new manuscript that described a publishing infrastructure that uses large language models to suggest revisions.
The abstract before revisions had a Flesh-Kincaid readability score of X and a grade level of Y.
It read as follows: "Academics often communicate through scholarly manuscripts.
These manuscripts describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
Writing and revising manuscripts can be a time-consuming process.
Large language models are bringing new capabilities to many areas of knowledge work.
We integrated the use of large language models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem.
Users of Manubot can run a workflow, which will trigger a series of queries to OpenAI's language models, produce revisions, and create a timestamped set of suggested revisions.
Given the amount of time that researchers put into crafting prose, we expect this advance to radically transform the type of knowledge work that academics perform." 

We believe that this technology will greatly reduce the time spent on writing and revising manuscripts and that it will have a significant impact on the type of knowledge work that academics perform.

After revisions, the abstract had a Flesh-Kincaid readability score of X and a grade level of Y.
The revised version read as follows: [citation]
