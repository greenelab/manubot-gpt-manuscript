## Evaluations of AI-based revisions {#sec:results}

### Evaluation setup

We used five different manuscript for the evaluation of our AI-based revision workflow (see below), and during the prompt engineering phase (see below), we also used a unit testing framework to ensure that the revisions produced by our prompts met a minimum set of quality measures (see Supplementary Material).

We evaluated our AI-assisted revision workflow using two models from OpenAI: Davinci (`text-davinci-003`) and GPT-3.5 Turbo (`gpt-3.5-turbo`).
The first one is based on GPT-3 Davinci models and used to be a production-ready model, although it was now succeeded by the new GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models.
We used the most capable GPT-4 Turbo model for evaluating the revisions (LLM-as-a-Judge).

For the evaluation of our tool, we conducted manual assessments performed by humans and automatic assessments performed by an LLM.
For the human assessments, we used three of our own manuscripts (Table @tbl:manuscripts): the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC) [@doi:10.1101/2022.06.15.496326], PhenoPLIER [@doi:10.1038/s41467-023-41057-4], and Manubot-AI (this manuscript).
CCC is a new correlation coefficient applied to transcriptomic data, while PhenoPLIER is a framework consisting of three different methods used in genetic studies.
CCC falls under the field of computational biology, whereas PhenoPLIER pertains to genomic medicine.
CCC outlines one computational method applied to a specific data type (correlation to gene expression).
In contrast, PhenoPLIER describes a framework that integrates three different approaches (regression, clustering, and drug-disease prediction) using data from genome-wide and transcription-wide association studies (GWAS and TWAS), gene expression, and transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations.
Thus, CCC has a simpler structure, while PhenoPLIER is a more complex manuscript with additional figures and tables, along with a Methods section that includes equations.
The third manuscript, Manubot-AI, has a much simpler structure and was written and revised using our tool prior to submission, demonstrating a practical AI-based revision use case.
For the automatic assessments, we incorporated two external manuscripts (with IDs BioChatter and Epistasis in Table @tbl:manuscripts).


#### Evaluation using human assessments

We enabled the Manubot AI revision workflow in the GitHub repositories of the three manuscripts (CCC, PhenoPLIER, and Manubot-AI).
This added the "ai-revision" workflow to the "Actions" tab of each repository.
We manually triggered the workflow and utilized the `text-davinci-003` language model to generate one pull request (PR) per manuscript.
These PRs can be accessed from the "Pull requests" tab of each repository.
The PRs display all the differences between the original text and the AI-based revision suggestions.

When manually assessing the quality of the revisions, we considered whether the revision:
1) preserve the original meaning,
2) preserve important details,
4) introduced new and incorrect information, and
5) preserve the correct Markdown format (e.g., citations, equations).


#### Evaluation using an LLM as a judge

For this evaluation, we ran our workflow on manuscripts CCC, PhenoPLIER, BioChatter, and Epistasis using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model (`gpt-3.5-turbo`).
We then inspected each PR and manually matched all pairs of original and revised paragraphs, across the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and supplementary material sections.
This procedure generated 31 paragraph pairs for CCC, 63 for PhenoPLIER, 37 for BioChatter, and 63 for Epistasis.
Using the LLM-as-a-Judge method [@arxiv:2306.05685], we evaluated the quality of the revisions using both GPT-3.5 Turbo (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) and GPT-4 Turbo (`gpt-4-turbo-preview`) as judges.
The judge is asked to decide which of the two paragraphs in each pair is better or if they are equally good (tie).
For this, we used prompt chaining, where the judge first evaluates the quality of each paragraph independently by writing a list with positive and negative aspects in the following areas: 1) clear sentence structure, 2) ease of understanding, 3) grammatical correctness, 4) absence of spelling errors.
Then, the judge was asked to be as objective as possible and decide if one of the paragraphs is clearly better than the other or if they are similar in quality, while also providing a rationale for the decision.
We also accounted for the case of position bias [@arxiv:2306.05685] (i.e., the order in which the paragraphs were presented could influence the decision) by swapping the order of the paragraphs.
Each assessment was repeated ten times.
The full prompt chain can be seen in Supplementary File 4, which includes an example of the output in each step generated by GPT-4 Turbo as a judge.


### Human assessments across different sections

Following our criteria for human assessments (see above), we inspected the PRs generated by the AI-based workflow and reported on our assessment of the changes suggested by the tool across different sections of the manuscripts.
The reader can access the PRs in the manuscripts' GitHub repositories (Table @tbl:manuscripts) and also included as diff files in Supplementary File 1 (CCC), 2 (PhenoPLIER), and 3 (Manubot-AI).


Below, we present the differences between the original text and the revisions made by the tool in a `diff` format (obtained from GitHub).
Line numbers are included to show the length differences.
Unless the AI suggestions represent a complete overhaul of the text, single words are underlined and highlighted in colors to more clearly see the differences within a single sentence.
Red indicates words removed by the tool, while green indicates words added; no underlining indicates words kept unchanged.
In the GitHub repositories, the full diffs can be seen by clicking on the "Files changed" tab under each PR.


#### Abstract

**Abstract of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
Single words are not underlined/highlighed in this case because the revision completely overhauled the text.
](images/diffs/abstract/ccc-abstract.svg "Diffs - CCC abstract"){#fig:abstract:ccc width="75%"}

We applied the AI-based revision workflow to the CCC abstract (Figure @fig:abstract:ccc).
The tool completely rewrote the text, leaving only the last sentence mostly unchanged.
The text was significantly shortened, and the sentences were longer than those in the original, which could make the abstract slightly harder to read.
The revision removed the first two sentences, which introduced correlation analyses and transcriptomics, and directly stated the purpose of the manuscript.
It also removed details about the method (line 5) and focused on the aims and results obtained, ending with the same last sentence, suggesting a broader application of the coefficient to other data domains (as originally intended by the authors of CCC).
The main concepts were still present in the revised text.


The revised text for the abstract of PhenoPLIER was significantly shortened (from 10 sentences in the original, to only 3 in the revised version).
However, in this case, important concepts (such as GWAS, TWAS, CRISPR) and a proper amount of background information were missing, producing a less informative abstract.


#### Introduction

![
**First paragraph in the Introduction section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/introduction/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC introduction paragraph 01"){#fig:intro:ccc width="75%"}

The tool significantly revised the Introduction section of CCC (Figure @fig:intro:ccc), producing a more concise and clear introductory paragraph.
The revised first sentence concisely incorporated ideas from the original two sentences, introducing the concept of "large datasets" and the opportunities for scientific exploration.
The model generated a more concise second sentence introducing the "need for efficient tools" to find "multiple relationships" in these datasets.
The third sentence connected nicely with the previous one.
All references to scientific literature were kept in the correct Manubot format, even though our prompts do not specify the references format.
The rest of the sentences in this section were also correctly revised and could be incorporated into the manuscript with minor or no further changes.


We also observed a high-quality revision of the introduction of PhenoPLIER.
However, the model failed to maintain the format of citations in one paragraph.
Additionally, the model did not converge to a revised text for the last paragraph, and our tool left an error message as an HTML comment at the top: `The AI model returned an empty string`.
Debugging the prompts revealed this issue, which could be related to the complexity of the paragraph.
In these cases, rerunning the automated revision might solve this type of issue.


#### Results

![
**A paragraph in the Results section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
Single words are not underlined/highlighed in this case because the revision completely overhauled the text.
](images/diffs/results/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC results paragraph 01"){#fig:results:ccc width="75%"}

We tested the tool on a paragraph from the Results section of CCC (Figure @fig:results:ccc).
This paragraph describes Figure 1 of the CCC manuscript [@doi:10.1101/2022.06.15.496326], which showcases four different datasets, each with two variables, and various relationships or patterns labeled as random/independent, non-coexistence, quadratic, and two-lines.
The revised paragraph, while having fewer sentences, is slightly longer and consistently uses the past tense, unlike the original one which has tense shifts.
The revised paragraph also retains all citations, which, although not explicitly mentioned in the prompts for this section (as it is for introductions), is important in this case.
The original LaTeX format was maintained for the math, and the figure was correctly referenced using the Manubot syntax.
In the third sentence of the revised paragraph (line 3), the model generated a good summary of how all coefficients performed in the last two nonlinear patterns, and why CCC was able to capture them.
As human authors, we would make a single change at the end of this sentence to avoid repeating the word "complexity": *"..., while CCC increased the model's complexity ~~by using different degrees of complexity~~ to capture the relationships."*
The revised paragraph is more concise and clearly describes what the figure shows and how CCC works.
It's remarkable that the model rewrote some of the concepts in the original paragraph (lines 4 to 8) into three new sentences (lines 3 to 5) with the same meaning, but more concisely and clearly.
The model also produced high-quality revisions for several other paragraphs that would only need minor changes.


However, other paragraphs in CCC required extensive changes before they could be incorporated into the manuscript.
For instance, the model generated revised text for certain paragraphs that was more concise, direct, and clear.
However, this often resulted in the removal of important details and occasionally altered the intended meaning of sentences.
To address this issue, we could accept the simplified sentence structure proposed by the model but reintroduce the missing details for clarity and completeness.

**A paragraph in the Results section of PhenoPLIER.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
Single words are not underlined/highlighed in this case because the revision completely overhauled the text.
](images/diffs/results/phenoplier-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - PhenoPLIER results paragraph 01"){#fig:results:phenoplier width="75%"}


When applied to the PhenoPLIER manuscript, the model produced high-quality revisions for most paragraphs while preserving citations and references to figures, tables, and other sections of the manuscript in the Manubot/Markdown format.
In some cases, important details were missing, but they could be easily added back while preserving the improved sentence structure of the revised version.
In other cases, the model's output demonstrated the limitations of revising one paragraph at a time without considering the rest of the text.
For instance, one paragraph described our CRISPR screening approach to assess whether top genes in a latent variable (LV) could represent good therapeutic targets.
The model generated a paragraph with a completely different meaning (Figure @fig:results:phenoplier).
It omitted the CRISPR screen and the gene symbols associated with the regulation of lipids, which were key elements in the original text.
Instead, the new text describes an experiment that does not exist, with a reference to a non-existent section.
This suggests that the model focused on the title and keywords of the manuscript (Table @tbl:manuscripts) that were part of every prompt (Figure @fig:ai_revision).
For example, it included the idea of "gene co-expression" analysis (a keyword) to identify "therapeutic targets" (another keyword) and replaced the mention of "sets of genes" in the original text with "clusters of genes" (closer to the keyword including "clustering").
This was a poor model-based revision, indicating that the original paragraph might be too short or disconnected from the rest and could be merged with the next one, which describes follow-up and related experiments.


#### Discussion

In both the CCC and PhenoPLIER manuscripts, revisions to the discussion section appeared to be of high quality.
The model kept the correct format when necessary (e.g., using italics for gene symbols), maintained most of the citations, and improved the readability of the text in general.
Revisions for some paragraphs introduced minor mistakes that a human author could readily fix.

![
**A paragraph in the Discussion section of CCC.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/discussion/ccc-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - CCC discussion paragraph 01"){#fig:discussion:ccc width="75%"}

One paragraph from CCC discusses how not-only-linear correlation coefficients could potentially impact genetic studies of complex traits (Figure @fig:discussion:ccc).
Although some minor changes could be incorporated, we believe the revised text reads better than the original.
It is also interesting to see how the model understood the format of citations and built more complex structures from it.
For instance, the two articles referenced in lines 2 and 3 of the original text were correctly merged into a single citation block and separated with a ";" in line 2 of the revised text.


#### Methods

Prompts for the Methods section were the most challenging to design, especially when the sections included equations.
The prompt for Methods (Figure @fig:ai_revision) is more focused in keeping the technical details, which was especially important for PhenoPLIER, whose Methods section contains paragraphs with several mathematical expressions.

![
**A paragraph in the Methods section of PhenoPLIER.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
](images/diffs/methods/phenoplier-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - PhenoPLIER methods paragraph 01"){#fig:methods:phenoplier width="75%"}

We revised a paragraph in PhenoPLIER that contained two numbered equations (Figure @fig:methods:phenoplier).
The model made very few changes, and all the equations, citations, and most of the original text were preserved.
However, we found it remarkable how the model identified an incorrect reference to a mathematical symbol (line 8) and corrected it in the revision (line 7).
Indeed, the equation with the univariate model used by PrediXcan (lines 4-6 in the original) includes the *true* effect size $\gamma_l$ (`\gamma_l`) instead of the *estimated* one $\hat{\gamma}_l$ (`\hat{\gamma}_l`).


In PhenoPLIER, we found one large paragraph with several equations that the model failed to revise, although it performed relatively well in revising the rest of the section.
In CCC, the revision of this section was good overall, with some minor and easy-to-fix issues as in the other sections.


We also observed issues arising from revising one paragraph at a time without context.
For instance, in PhenoPLIER, one of the first paragraphs mentions the linear models used by S-PrediXcan and S-MultiXcan without providing any equations or details.
These were presented in the following paragraphs, but since the model had not yet encountered that information, it opted to add those equations immediately (in the correct Manubot/Markdown format).


![
**A paragraph in the Methods section of ManubotAI.**
Original text is on the left and suggested revision on the right.
The revision (right) contains a repeated set of sentences at the top that we removed to improve the clarity of the figure.
](images/diffs/methods/manubotai-paragraph-01.svg "Diffs - ManubotAI methods paragraph 01"){#fig:methods:manubotai width="75%"}


When revising the Methods sections of Manubot-AI (this manuscript), the model, in some cases, added novel sentences containing incorrect information.
For example, for one paragraph, it included a formula (using the correct Manubot format) presumably to predict the cost of a revision run.
In another paragraph (Figure @fig:methods:manubotai), it introduced new sentences stating that the model was *"trained on a corpus of scientific papers from the same field as the manuscript"* and that its suggested revisions resulted in a *"modified version of the manuscript that is ready for submission."*
Although these are important future directions, neither statement accurately describes the present work.


### Automated assessments

![
**Automated assessment of preference over revised paragraphs.**
A revision score ($y$-axis) close to 1 indicates that the LLM acting as a judge preferred the revised paragraph over the original one, while a score of -1 indicates the opposite; a zero value indicates either a tie or position bias.
Each point represents the average score of paragraphs from a section in one of the four manuscripts: CCC, PhenoPLIER, BioChatter and Epistasis.
](images/llm_judge.svg "Automated assessments using LLM-as-a-Judge"){#fig:llm_judge width="90%"}

The automatic assessment of paragraphs from different sections across four manuscripts is depicted in Figure @fig:llm_judge.
It can be seen that the two models used as judges, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo, generally agreed and favored the revised paragraphs over the original ones (revision score above zero) in most cases.
The only section where the original paragraphs were clearly preferred was the Abstract of the PhenoPLIER and Epistasis manuscripts.
GPT-3.5 Turbo showed a preference for the original abstract of PhenoPLIER in most cases, and the model rationale (Supplementary File 5) aligns with our human assessment: the original abstract provides a more "detailed explanation" of the approaches and a "comprehensive overview of the research."
