We used the Manubot infrastructure to revise an existing manuscript and author a new one.
The new manuscript describes the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), a measure designed to capture both linear and non-linear relationships between variables.
The CCC is particularly useful for analyzing gene expression data, as described in the manuscript [@doi:10.1101/2022.06.15.496326].
We back-ported the changes in Manubot to this manuscript.

The abstract of the CCC manuscript had a Flesh-Kincaid readability score of X and a grade level of Y before revision.

After Manubot's AI-assisted revisions, the Flesh-Kincaid score improved to A and the grade level dropped to B.

The abstract of the CCC

The Manubot system was tested to measure its impact on readability.
After suggested revisions, the readability score was X and the grade level was Y.
This indicates that Manubot has the potential to improve the readability of scholarly publishing, particularly when assisted by

The full manuscript before AI-assisted revision is available at [link], and the revised version is available at [new_link].
We noticed that the model has difficulty with the Manubot citation style, which may lead to some incorrect references.
This pipeline is not fully automated; authors must review changes and verify the output.

We used this framework to author a new manuscript that described a publishing infrastructure implementing large language models to suggest revisions.
The abstract before revisions had a Flesh-Kincaid readability score of X and a grade level of Y.
It read: 

> Academics often communicate through scholarly manuscripts.
> These manuscripts describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
> Writing and revising manuscripts can be a time-consuming process.
> Large language models are bringing new capabilities to many areas of knowledge work.
> We integrated the use of large language models into the Manubot publishing ecosystem.
> Users of Manubot can run a workflow, which will trigger a series of queries to OpenAI's language models, produce revisions, and create a timestamped set of suggested revisions.
> Given the amount of time that researchers put into crafting prose, we expect this advance to radically transform the type of knowledge work that academics perform.

We anticipate that this advance will significantly improve the speed and accuracy of academic writing.
It will also enable academics to devote more time to the creative aspects of their work.

The results of our study showed that using Manubot and AI-assisted authoring improved the readability of the abstract.
The Flesh-Kincaid readability score was X and the grade level was Y.
The revised abstract read as follows:
