## Introduction

The manuscript pre-dates the invention of printing by thousands of years, but the practice of producing exclusively scientific journals only started roughly 350 years ago [@isbn:0810808447].
The implementation of external peer review varies by journal but for many is less than 100 years old [@doi:10/d26d8b].
To date, most manuscripts have been written by humans or teams of humans working together to describe scholarly advances.

Modern scholarly manuscripts often describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
However, writing and revising can be a time-consuming process.
Academics can sometimes be long-winded in getting to key points, making writing more impenetrable to their audience [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4].

Modern computing capabilities and the widespread availability of text, images, and other data on the internet has laid the foundation for artificial intelligence (AI) models with many parameters.
Large language models, in particular, are opening the floodgates to new technologies with the capability to transform how society operates [@arxiv:2102.02503].
The GPT-3 model, with its 175 billion parameters, has demonstrated strong performance on many tasks [@arxiv:2005.14165].

We developed a software publishing platform that imagines a future where authors co-write their manuscripts with the support of large language models.
We used, as a base, the Manubot platform for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].
Manubot was designed as an end-to-end publishing platform for scholarly writing for both individual and large-collaborative projects.
It has been used for collaborations of approximately 50 authors writing hundreds of pages of text reviewing progress during the COVID19 pandemic [@pmid:34545336].
We developed a new workflow that parses the manuscript, uses a large language model with section-specific custom prompts to revise the manuscript, and then creates a set of suggested changes to reach the revised state.
Changes are presented to the user through the GitHub interface for author review and integration into the published document.
