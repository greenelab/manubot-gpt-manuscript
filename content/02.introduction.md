# Introduction

However, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and its application to the academic authoring process has the potential to revolutionize the way scholarly work is produced.

Manuscripts have been around for thousands of years, but scientific journals only began appearing roughly 350 years ago [@isbn:0810808447].
The external peer review process, which is now used by many journals, was only introduced in the last 100 years [@doi:10/d26d8b].
Traditionally, manuscripts have been written by humans, or teams of humans, to document scholarly advances.
But with the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the academic authoring process is poised for a revolution.
Manubot, a software that uses AI to assist in authoring, is at the forefront of this transformation.

Creating scholarly manuscripts can be a laborious process, taking up a lot of time.
Academics may struggle to get their key points across in a concise manner, making their writing difficult to understand for their readers [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4].

The emergence of AI technology has enabled the development of a new publishing infrastructure for academic authors â€“ Manubot.
Manubot is a software that leverages AI to automate aspects of scholarly publishing, such as the production of manuscripts and the review process.
This paper presents an overview of Manubot and its potential to revolutionize academic authoring.

We have created a software publishing platform that enables authors to co-write their manuscripts with the help of large language models.
Our platform is based on the Manubot platform for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128], which was designed to support both individual and collaborative writing projects.
Manubot has already been used for collaborations of up to 50 authors writing hundreds of pages of text about the progress of the COVID19 pandemic [@pmid:34545336].
Our workflow parses the manuscript, uses a large language model with tailored prompts for each section to revise the manuscript, and then generates a set of suggested changes.
These changes are presented to the user via the GitHub interface, allowing them to review and integrate them into the published document.
