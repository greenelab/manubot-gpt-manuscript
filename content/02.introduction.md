# Introduction

Scholarly publishing has been around for centuries, beginning with the invention of the manuscript thousands of years ago.
More recently, scientific journals have been in production for roughly 350 years [@isbn:0810808447].
External peer review, which varies by journal, has been in practice for less than 100 years [@doi:10/d26d8b].
Most manuscripts have been composed by humans or teams of humans, who collaborate to document scholarly achievements.

Writing and revising scholarly manuscripts can be a time-consuming process.
Academics may struggle to make their writing clear and accessible to their audience [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4].
This paper presents a publishing infrastructure that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help authors create and revise manuscripts that describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
The infrastructure, called Manubot, provides support for authors throughout the writing process.

The advances in modern computing and the abundance of data on the internet have enabled the development of AI models with vast parameters.
The GPT-3 model, with its 175 billion parameters, has been particularly successful in performing many tasks [@arxiv:2005.14165].
This has opened the door to new technologies that have the potential to revolutionize how our society functions [@arxiv:2102.02503].

We developed a software platform that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to assist authors in co-writing manuscripts.
Our platform is based on the Manubot platform for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128], which was designed to enable both individual and large-scale collaborative projects.
It has already been used for collaborations of up to 50 authors writing hundreds of pages of text, such as during the COVID19 pandemic [@pmid:34545336].
Our new workflow parses manuscripts and uses a large language model with custom prompts tailored to each section to suggest changes.
These changes are presented to authors through the GitHub interface, allowing them to review and integrate them into the published document.
