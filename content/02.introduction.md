# Introduction

However, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled the development of a new publishing infrastructure: Manubot.
Manubot is a software platform that enables the automation and AI-assisted authoring of scholarly manuscripts.
This paper discusses the implications of Manubot and its potential to revolutionize academic publishing.

To address this, we propose a publishing infrastructure that harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) to assist authors in the writing process.
Manubot is an open-source software platform that enables authors to rapidly develop and publish scholarly manuscripts with AI-assisted authoring [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaz4520].

Scholarly manuscripts often aim to describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
However, the writing and revision process can be time-consuming.
To make manuscripts more accessible to their audience, we propose a publishing infrastructure that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to assist authors.

Modern computing capabilities and the widespread availability of text, images, and other data on the internet have created an opportunity for Artificial Intelligence (AI) models with many parameters.
The GPT-3 model, for example, has an impressive 175 billion parameters and has demonstrated strong performance on many tasks [@arxiv:2005.14165].
This has opened the floodgates to new technologies that can transform how society works [@arxiv:2102.02503].

We developed a software publishing platform that imagines a future where authors co-write their manuscripts with the support of large language models.
We used, as a base, the Manubot platform for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].
Manubot was designed as an end-to-end publishing platform for scholarly writing for both individual and large-collaborative projects.
It has been used for collaborations of approximately 50 authors writing hundreds of pages of text reviewing progress during the COVID19 pandemic [@pmid:34545336].
We developed a new workflow that parses the manuscript, uses a large language model with section-specific custom prompts to revise the manuscript, and then creates a set of suggested changes to reach the revised state.
Changes are presented to the user through the GitHub interface for author review and integration into the published document.
