## Introduction

The manuscript pre-dates the invention of printing by thousands of years, but the practice of producing exclusively scientific journals only started roughly 350 years ago [@isbn:0810808447].
The implementation of external peer review varies by journal but for many is less than 100 years old [@doi:10/d26d8b].
To date, most manuscripts have been written by humans or teams of humans working together to describe scholarly advances.


Modern scholarly manuscripts often describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
However, writing and revising can be a time-consuming process, and several steps are at least partly repetitive.
Academics can sometimes be long-winded in getting to key points, making writing more impenetrable to their audience [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4].


Modern computing capabilities and the widespread availability of text, images, and other data on the internet has laid the foundation for artificial intelligence (AI) models with billions of parameters.
Large language models, in particular, are opening the floodgates to new technologies with the capability to transform how society operates [@arxiv:2102.02503].
OpenAI's models have been trained on vast amounts of data and can generate human-like text [@arxiv:2005.14165].
These models are based on the transformer architecture and use self-attention mechanisms to process language.
The most well-known of these models is Generative Pre-training Transformer 3 (GPT-3), which is capable of generating text, completing code, answering questions, and performing various other language tasks.
These models have been shown to be highly effective at a wide range of language tasks, and have the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing.
Indeed, they might also revolutionize how we write and revise drafts of scientific manuscripts by saving researchers time and effort, allowing them to focus on more high-level tasks such as data analysis and interpretation.


We developed a software publishing platform that imagines a future where authors co-write their manuscripts with the support of large language models.
We used, as a base, the Manubot platform for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].
Manubot was designed as an end-to-end publishing platform for scholarly writing for both individual and large-collaborative projects.
It has been used for collaborations of approximately 50 authors writing and reviewing hundreds of pages of text during the COVID19 pandemic [@pmid:34545336].
We developed a new workflow that parses the manuscript, uses a large language model with section-specific custom prompts to revise the manuscript, and then creates a set of suggested changes to reach the revised state.
Changes are presented to the user through the GitHub interface for author review and integration into the published document.
