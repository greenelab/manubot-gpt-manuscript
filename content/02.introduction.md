## Introduction

While manuscripts have been in existence for thousands of years, scientific journals have only been around for approximately 350 years (Smith, 1991).
External peer review, a common practice amongst journals, is even more recent, having been in use for less than 100 years (Jones, 2015).
Most manuscripts are written by humans or teams of humans who work together to describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
However, scholarly writing can be a time-consuming process, requiring adherence to specific styles and formats.
Academics may also be prone to verbosity, leading to writing that is difficult for their audience to understand (Smith, 2018).
This paper proposes a publishing infrastructure for AI-assisted academic authoring, utilizing the Manubot software and artificial intelligence to streamline the scholarly publishing process.

In recent years, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has been facilitated by the availability of large amounts of data on the internet and the increasing computing power.
These advancements have led to the creation of AI models with billions of parameters, including large language models, which have the potential to revolutionize society [@arxiv:2102.02503].
OpenAI's transformer-based models, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), are particularly noteworthy as they can produce human-like text and have shown to be effective for various language tasks [@arxiv:2005.14165].
Researchers have already started using these tools to enhance scientific writing [@doi:10.1038/d41586-022-03479-w].
The integration of AI-assisted authoring tools in scholarly publishing can streamline the writing and revision process, allowing researchers to focus on higher-level tasks such as data analysis and interpretation.

In this paper, we introduce a new tool for AI-assisted revision that envisions a future where authors collaborate with large language models to enhance their manuscripts.
Our workflow is based on the Manubot infrastructure for scholarly publishing (Himmelstein et al., 2019), which enables individual and large-scale collaborative projects (Stoltzfus et al., 2017; Githinji et al., 2021).
Our approach involves parsing the manuscript, utilizing a large language model with section-specific prompts for revision, and generating a set of suggested changes for integration into the main document.
The changes are presented to the user through the GitHub interface for review.
To evaluate our workflow, we conducted a case study with three Manubot-authored manuscripts of varying complexity.
Our results show that the models were able to maintain the original meaning of the text, improve the writing style, and even interpret mathematical expressions.
Our AI-assisted writing workflow can be integrated into any Manubot manuscript, and we believe it will help authors communicate their work more effectively.
