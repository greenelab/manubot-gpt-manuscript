## Introduction

The tradition of scholarly writing dates back thousands of years, evolving significantly with the advent of scientific journals approximately 350 years ago [@isbn:0810808447].
External peer review, used by many journals, is even more recent, having been around for less than 100 years [@doi:10/d26d8b].
Most manuscripts are written by individuals or teams working together to describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.
However, scholarly writing is a time-consuming process in which the results of a study are presented using a specific style and format.
Academics can sometimes be long-winded in getting to key points, making their writing more impenetrable to their audience [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4].

The paragraph is well-written and does not require any corrections.

In this work, we present a human-centric approach for the use of AI in manuscript writing.
Here, scholarly text, initially created by humans, is revised through edit suggestions from LLMs, and is ultimately reviewed and approved by humans.
This approach mitigates the risk of generating misleading information while still providing the benefits of AI-assisted writing.
We developed an AI-assisted revision tool that implements this approach and builds on the Manubot infrastructure for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128], a platform designed to enable both individual and large-scale collaborative projects [@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387; @pmid:34545336].
Our tool, named the Manubot AI Editor, parses the manuscript, utilizes an LLM with section-specific prompts for revision, and then generates a set of suggested changes to be integrated into the main document.
These changes are presented to the user through the GitHub interface for review.
During prompt engineering, we developed unit tests to ensure that a minimum set of quality measures are met by the AI revisions.
For end-to-end evaluation, we manually reviewed the AI revisions on three Manubot-authored manuscripts that included sections of varying complexity.
Our findings indicate that, in most cases, the models were able to maintain the original meaning of text, improve the writing style, and even interpret mathematical expressions.
Officially part of the Manubot platform, our Manubot AI Editor can be readily incorporated into Manubot-based manuscripts, and we anticipate it will help authors more effectively communicate their work.
