## Introduction

Manuscripts have been around for thousands of years, but scientific journals have only been around for about 350 years [@isbn:0810808447].
External peer review, which is used by many journals, is even more recent, having been around for less than 100 years [@doi:10/d26d8b].
Most manuscripts are written by humans or teams of humans, but the process can be very time-consuming.
Scholars often need to present their findings in a specific style and format, which can make the writing difficult for their audience to understand [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4].
Manuscripts usually describe new advances, summarize existing literature, or argue for changes in the status quo.

Recent advances in computing capabilities and the widespread availability of text, images, and other data on the internet have laid the foundation for artificial intelligence (AI) models with billions of parameters.
OpenAI's models, for instance, have been trained on vast amounts of data and can generate human-like text [@arxiv:2005.14165].
These models are based on the transformer architecture which uses self-attention mechanisms to model the complexities of language.
The most well-known of these models is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), which have been shown to be highly effective for a range of language tasks such as generating text, completing code, and answering questions [@arxiv:2005.14165].
This has the potential to revolutionize how scientists write and revise scholarly manuscripts, saving time and effort and enabling researchers to focus on more high-level tasks such as data analysis and interpretation.

We present a novel AI-assisted revision tool that envisions a future where authors collaborate with large language models in the writing of their manuscripts.
This workflow builds on the Manubot infrastructure for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128], a platform designed to enable both individual and large-scale collaborative projects [@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387; @pmid:34545336].
Our workflow involves parsing the manuscript, utilizing a large language model with section-specific prompts for revision, and then generating a set of suggested changes to be integrated into the published document.
These changes are presented to the user through the GitHub interface for review.
To evaluate our workflow, we conducted a case study with three Manubot-authored manuscripts that included sections of varying complexity.
Our findings indicate that, in most cases, the models were able to maintain the original meaning of text, improve the writing style, and even interpret mathematical expressions.
Our AI-assisted writing workflow can be incorporated into any Manubot manuscript, and we anticipate it will help authors more effectively communicate their work.
