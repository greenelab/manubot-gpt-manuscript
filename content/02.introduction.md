## Introduction


Scholarly writing has evolved since the first scientific journals 350 years ago, adopting practices like external peer review in the last century [@isbn:0810808447; @doi:10/d26d8b].
It often involves dense language to convey new advances or literature summaries [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4].
Meanwhile, recent computing advances have enabled large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 [@arxiv:2005.14165], revolutionizing technologies and applications in various fields, including medical informatics and scientific communication [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocad072; @doi:10.1093/jamia/ocad245].
These models promise to streamline scientific writing [@doi:10.1038/d41586-022-03479-w], though their use raises accuracy and ethical concerns [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocad104; @doi:10.1093/jamia/ocad091].


We introduce a human-centric AI method for scholarly writing, leveraging LLMs for draft revision within the Manubot platform, a tool for collaborative publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128].
Here, we propose the Manubot AI Editor, which suggests revisions via GitHub, balancing AI's efficiency with human oversight to ensure accuracy.
Tested on five manuscripts, we found it maintained the original meaning, improved style, and handled complex expressions, proving a valuable addition to the Manubot suite.
We anticipate our tool will help authors more effectively communicate their work.
