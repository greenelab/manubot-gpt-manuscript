# Introduction

Manuscripts have been around for thousands of years, but scientific journals were only established about 350 years ago [@isbn:0810808447].
The practice of external peer review, which is implemented by many journals, is less than 100 years old [@doi:10/d26d8b].
Until now, the majority of manuscripts have been created by people or teams of people who work together to document scholarly developments.

Writing and revising scholarly manuscripts can be a time-consuming process.
Academics often struggle to get to their key points in a concise manner, which can make their writing difficult for their audience to comprehend [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4].
Modern scholarly manuscripts typically aim to describe new advances, summarize existing research, or argue for changes to the status quo.

This has enabled the development of Manubot, a software platform that leverages AI to assist with the authoring of academic papers [@arxiv:1910.09729].

The rapid advances in computing and the availability of text, images, and other data on the internet have enabled the development of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models with numerous parameters.
The GPT-3 model, for example, has demonstrated excellent performance on many tasks and contains 175 billion parameters [@arxiv:2005.14165].
This has paved the way for the development of Manubot, a software platform that uses AI to help authors create academic papers [@arxiv:1910.09729].
With its potential to revolutionize how society operates [@arxiv:2102.02503], Manubot provides an exciting opportunity for scholarly publishing.

We developed a software publishing platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to assist authors in co-writing manuscripts.
As a base, we used the Manubot platform for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128], which was designed for individual and large-collaborative projects.
It has been successfully used for collaborations of up to 50 authors writing hundreds of pages of text, such as during the COVID19 pandemic [@pmid:34545336].
Our platform parses the manuscript, uses a large language model with section-specific custom prompts to revise it, and then creates a set of suggested changes.
These changes are presented to the author through the GitHub interface for review and integration into the published document.
