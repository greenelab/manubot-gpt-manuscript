## Introduction

Manuscripts have been around for thousands of years, but scientific journals have only been around for about 350 years [@isbn:0810808447].
External peer review, used by many journals, has been around for less than 100 years [@doi:10/d26d8b].
Scholarly writing is a time-consuming process in which academics present the results of a study in a specific style and format.
However, this can lead to long-winded writing, making it difficult for readers to understand the key points of the paper [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02404-4].
To address this issue, a new publishing infrastructure for AI-assisted academic authoring has been developed.
This infrastructure, called Manubot, uses artificial intelligence to help authors streamline their writing, making it easier to understand for readers.

Recent advances in computing power and the availability of text, images, and other data on the internet have enabled the development of AI models with billions of parameters.
For example, OpenAI's models are based on the transformer architecture which uses self-attention mechanisms to model the complexities of language [@arxiv:2102.02503].
The most well-known of these models is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) which is highly effective for a range of language tasks such as generating text, completing code, and answering questions [@arxiv:2005.14165].
Scientists are already using these tools to improve scientific writing [@doi:10.1038/d41586-022-03479-w], and this technology has the potential to revolutionize how scholars write and revise manuscripts, saving time and effort and enabling researchers to focus on more high-level tasks such as data analysis and interpretation.

We present a novel tool that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist authors in revising manuscripts.
This workflow builds on the Manubot infrastructure for scholarly publishing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128], a platform designed to enable both individual and large-scale collaborative projects [@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387; @pmid:34545336].
It involves parsing the manuscript, utilizing a large language model with section-specific prompts for revision, and then generating a set of suggested changes to be integrated into the main document.
These changes are then presented to the user through the GitHub interface for review.
To evaluate our workflow, we conducted a case study with three Manubot-authored manuscripts that included sections of varying complexity.
Our findings indicate that, in most cases, the AI models were able to maintain the original meaning of the text, improve the writing style, and even interpret mathematical expressions.
We believe our AI-assisted writing workflow can be incorporated into any Manubot manuscript, and we anticipate it will help authors communicate their work more effectively.
