# Conclusions

We implemented AI-based models into publishing infrastructure.
While most manuscripts have been written by humans, the process is time consuming and academic writing can be difficult to parse.
We sought to develop a technology that academics could use to make their writing more understandable without changing the fundamental meaning.
This work lays the foundation for a future where academic manuscripts are constructed by a process that incorporates both human and machine authors.
