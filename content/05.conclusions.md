# Conclusions

We implemented AI-based models into publishing infrastructure to reduce the time and effort needed to write academic manuscripts.
Our goal was to develop a technology that would make it easier to understand the writing without changing the fundamental meaning.
This work provides a foundation for a future where academic manuscripts are created with the help of both human and machine authors.
