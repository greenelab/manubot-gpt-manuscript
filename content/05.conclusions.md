# Conclusions

We developed a technology that allows academics to make their writing more comprehensible without altering its fundamental meaning.
This technology is based on AI-based models and integrated into a publishing infrastructure.
This work paves the way for a future where academic manuscripts are created through a process that combines both human and machine authorship.
This could significantly reduce the time and effort required to create manuscripts while allowing for a more accurate and easily understood result.
